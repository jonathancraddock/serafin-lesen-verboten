Serafin and Plum were comfortably gliding through the air in the balloon
 when suddenly a thunderstorm broke out. "Hold on tight!" Serafin 
shouted, but by then it was already over for Plum. A gust of wind had 
simply swept him overboard! Terrified and disbelieving, Serafin stared 
into the depths. But 0 wonder - down there, Plum was hanging from the 
balloon's anchor with his sweater. Help, Serafina, screamed Plum. *The 
sweater is ripping!" *Hold on to the anchor! I'll pull you up!" But that
 was hard work. Serafin almost dislocated his arm until Plum was finally
 safely back in the basket. The wind was still shaking the ropes as if 
it wanted to tear the balloon into a thousand pieces, but gradually the 
storm subsided. The two friends were about to breathe a sigh of relief 
when they noticed a new danger. The storm had torn holes in the balloon,
 and now they were sinking rapidly into the depths. "I don't know, but 
there's a village down there with lots of meadows. We're heading 
straight for it... Watch out, we're already there

And the next moment, Serafin and Plum were hanging from the church spire along with their basket and balloon. 
This caused a commotion and everyone ran to see the strange guests. The fastest to arrive was the police and they didn't find the story funny. "
"Don't you know that it is forbidden to enter our country without a passport? "
"But it was an accident"
"There is no such thing. It's forbidden, that's that. You have to go back immediately."

And before they knew it, Serafin and Plum were being gently pushed across the border: "You'd better do your mischief somewhere else, you good-for-nothings!" They fared no better at the border post opposite. Even from a distance, the officials looked suspiciously at the two foreigners. "Have you got permission to enter our country? No? Then make sure you get on, but quickly!" What now? Dejected, the two friends took advice. You had been thrown out of one country and were not allowed to enter the other. How were you supposed to get back home? Plum, whose stomach was growling once again, was already imagining how he would have to starve to death between the two border posts. But then came Serafin's thanks. "No man's land," he said.

#### Page 4

*"No man's land?" asked Plum. "You know, the strip of ground that separates two countries. We're standing on it, and nobody can touch us here. *Aha," said Plum, but still hadn't quite realised what his friend wanted- "Quite simple," explained Serafin. 'We always go after no man's land, and if we're lucky, we'll eventually get to the sea. Then we can escape there." But the hike was unlikely to be successful. Wherever they went, there were always watchtowers to the right and left. From there, police with telescopes watched the area suspiciously. Sometimes they came across people arguing bitterly with each other and swearing at each other across the border. *It's a pity that it's so difficult to live together in peace!"

But that wasn't the worst of it. When they came to the gorge, over which a bridge led high above, they really believed that war would break out between the two countries at any moment. There was a large gaping hole in the bridge. Crowds of people had gathered on both sides, shouting wildly at each other. Soldiers stood there with their rifles at the ready, and even cannons had been raised - it was a terrifying sight. Little by little, Serafin and Plum learnt what had happened. In the morning, the border guards of both countries suddenly realised that there was a hole in the bridge. So they accused each other of having caused the damage. Of course, each of them proclaimed their innocence, but neither believed the other. Bridge engineers came and measured the length and width of the hole. But even they could not determine who had actually made it. When nobody knew what to do, the soldiers were finally called in to help. Nothing had happened yet, but the situation was very serious. Serafin and Plum were only thinking about how they could get out of this dangerous place as quickly as possible. "That reminds me," said Plum, "Didn't we fly over this ravine this morning?" "Of course, in the middle of a storm." 
"That's right - and the storm destroyed the bridge and nobody else!"*"The storm!" laughed a soldier standing next to them."Why not the expensive grandmother?No, believe me: it was them.Plum wanted to say more, but nobody listened to him.Then Serafin suddenly smiled mischievously.Without asking anyone, he made his way through the crowd until he reached the hole.As if on command, the clamour fell silent.Everyone's eyes widened as Serafin calmly laid one plank after the other on their stcllc and nailed them down.An hour later, Serafin and Plum reached the sea.

"The sea" screamed Plum and did three somersaults in the sand. "We are saved!" "Look, you can even see the Heiligenstadt lighthouse over there.It's not far home now.Can you actually swim, Plurn?"
"Well, not particularly.Is it bad?"
Serafin had already discovered a shipwreck rotting on the beach: Ach wo, doesn't matter. We can build a good raft from these beams. 
But Serafin had already discovered a shipwreck rotting on the beach: "Never mind. Let's get to work!"

#### Page 7

Those of you who have read Serafin's previous adventures know how good Se- rafin is at crafting. So it didn't take long for the raft to be finished. And what a raft it was! It not only had a sail, but also paddle wheels and a cabin and - you have to see it for yourselves! The next morning, Scrafin and Plum set sail after a good breakfast of fried fish. They crossed the bay in no time at all."I can't wait to get back home," said Plum as they sailed into the harbour.The first quay they wanted to dock at was only for cargo ships.They were sent to the marina.There, a large sign reading PRIVATE PORT forbade them to enter. 
The next basin was strictly guarded: it was the military zone. *What do they think they're doing," Serafin said indignantly. "We can't stay on the water forever!" At that moment, the raft was lifted into the air by a huge foaming wave. "A seaquake shouted Plum. " "Save yourself, who can!"

Finally, Serafin and Plum discovered a piece of beach that anyone was allowed to set foot on. "Phew," said Plum as he jumped off the raft. "It feels wonderful to have solid ground under my feet again." Then a hand rested on Serafin's shoulder. A customs officer stood before them. "Does this raft belong to you? Do you have a customs certificate and a sailing permit?"

"Why," said Serafin. "I..."

"Oh, talking back, are we? That's just what we like. Be at the police station today at noon sharp."

Later, when Serafin and Plum tried to make a fire, a forest ranger rushed over: "Can't you read? This is quite something. I expect you at the police station at noon today."

Then Serafin tried to catch some fish for dinner. But the beach warden wasn't far away: "You think you can just catch fish here without a fishing permit? Today at noon..."

"I know," Serafin interrupted him. "At the police station."

"My lords," said the sergeant to Serafin and Plum after listening to all the complaints. "You've really gotten yourselves into some trouble. This is concerning, very concerning."

Serafin tried to prove his innocence. They hadn't meant to do anything wrong.

"Anyone can say that," grumbled the sergeant. "Show me your identification."

"Our identification? Yes, of course, where did I put them..."

Suddenly, the guardhouse began to spin before Serafin's eyes: his wallet was gone! Had he lost it during the storm? Or when he fell onto the church tower? Or... Once more, he searched all his pockets, but the wallet remained missing.

"What?" gasped the sergeant. "You don't have identification either? This just keeps getting better!"

Then he asked our friends so many questions that it made their heads spin. They even had their fingerprints taken. It was almost evening by the time they were provisionally released. "But don't even think about running away, and be back here first thing in the morning! Further down the road is an abandoned house where you can spend the night."

"But it's awfully drafty here," exclaimed Plum when they arrived at the half-ruined house.

"If we board up the window openings with planks, it will be fine," Serafin reassured him.
